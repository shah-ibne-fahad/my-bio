            <p>The CSS box model is a <strong>fundamental concept</strong> in
                CSS that describes how
                elements are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated.
                <em>It
                    consists of four components</em> : content, padding, border,
                and margin.
                Together, these components form a rectangular box around an
                element.</p>
